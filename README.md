==================

This is a repository designed simply for me to test out the development of
minecraft bukkit server plugins. If you are bored enough to follow this,
well you have too much time on your hands to start with but, I do appreciate
the support of anyone following this. Though I might mention as a side note,
I am just starting out and currently know next to nothing on this subject...
So, you have been warned.
